## Warning
### Unfortunately one of quirks of this system is that it forces programmers to use only one file to write their solutions which affects readability.
### Due to the fact that most of challenges have limited timeframe, (Initial challenge with prices. Later most of the games are open for players to compete but without additional incentives) some of the attached code has been writen under pressure of time, which might have had a negative impact of said code readability



[CodinGame](www.codingame.com) is a platform where programmers can compete in challenges to write the best performing bot.
Players are tasked with writing a bot that each game frame takes input data and outputs a set of commands (eg. moves some units to given coordinates). Later server clashes code of different contestant to determine the best performing algorithm and adjust theri placement in competition bracked based on results.
This is a repository of my past submitions for past challenges.
